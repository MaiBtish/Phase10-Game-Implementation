# Phase10 Game Implementation

Authors: Nada Abughazalah and [MaiBtish](https://github.com/MaiBtish)

As the course project for the Advanced Programming (EE364) course 

Three classes were created:

`Cards.java` manages adding and shuffling the game cards

`GameLayout.java` manages the main design and layout of the program

`PhaseTenGame.java` is the main class which has the code for the essential rules and event handling

To replicate the appearance of the game's cards, their images are created by Nada on Adobe Photoshop.
